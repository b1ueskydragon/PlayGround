Given an infinite sorted array (or an array with unknown size), find out if a given number key is present in the array.
Write a function to return the index of the key if it is present in the array, otherwise return -1.

As it is not possible to define an array with infinite (unknown) size,
you will be provided with an interface ArrayReader to read elements of the array.

ArrayReader.get(index) will return the number at the index;
if the array’s size is smaller than the index, it will return Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Example:
Input: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30], key = 16
Output: 6.

Explanation:
The key is present at index ‘6’ in the array.
